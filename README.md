# Pixel-Quest---Rafael-Schneweiss
2D Plataform Game in Python by Rafael Schneweiss

This is the first version of Pixel Quest, a 2D platform game created in Python. Right now only one stage is available, but you can create other levels (edit csv files and game data). if you want to try the game, the available inputs are: Up, Down, Left, Right, Space, Return, LShift and LCtrl Code still a bit messy, but running without bugs
